Feel comfortable walking fast or slow. We'll try to stay together, but when the group gets large enough, we often split into two (or more) groups with an experienced member \"sweeping\" the trail.  We'll try not to lose anybody, but please call me if you get lost.  We do this for fellowship, exercise, and fun.  It's not a race!  The hike pauses at selected locations, so we may regroup and permit those who need a rest, time to catch their breath.  The hike resumes when I am comfortable that everyone is ready. This also helps assure that we don't lose anyone along the way.<\/p> <p>All are welcome to stay and enjoy a great post-hike Thai dinner. I think it's best Thai food in Nashville.<\/p> <p>Dress for the weather, wear comfortable footwear, and bring some water as necessary. See downtown Nashville up close, stop the world from spinning in Bicentennial Mall, and ring the State Capitol Liberty Bell (while avoiding capitol police).<\/p> <p><img src=\"https:\/\/img2.meetupstatic.com\/1723755200050492932723\/img\/smileys\/biggrin.gif\" \/><\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p><b>LOCATION DETAILS:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Thai Phooket<\/b>: 207 Woodland Street, Nashville, TN 37213<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p><b>MISCELLANEOUS:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Questions?<\/b> Call or text Preston @[masked]<\/p> <p><b>Running late?<\/b> Please call or text Preston, but please don't text and drive.<\/p> <p><b>Can't make it?<\/b> Please be courteous and change your RSVP as early as possible!<\/p> <p><b>Posted times are departure times.<\/b> We will leave on time unless we have a compelling reason to wait a few minutes longer.<\/p>",
