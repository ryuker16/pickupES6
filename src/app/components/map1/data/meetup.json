We will begin at the Big East Fork Retreat at 9am for coffee to get the energy groovin'. After a little coffee and some socializing, we will be exploring the scenic trails around the lake, along the creek, past the farm and up Peach Orchard Hollow to the Nachez Trace then down through Sunset Meadow, a future camping site. After the hike, we will reorganize at the retreat for juice, bagels and conversation.
